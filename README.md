# xdg-desktop-portal-bypass
xdg-desktop-portal-bypass is a specialized xdg-desktop-portal backend. Its goal is to implement xdg-desktop-portal interfaces through bypassed methods (including privileged ones) to allow compositors that have no full interface implementation to use missing functions.

We will prioritize implementing interfaces related to Remote Desktop, excluding Screencast and Screenshot.
